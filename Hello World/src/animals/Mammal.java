// Abstract classes cannot be instantiated

// Technically, we can define a constructor which will be called, but we
// cannot create types of exactly this class

// Abstract classes imply hierarchy. They are part of the inheritance hierarchy
// of the class. It should also be noted generally regarding inheritance that 
// you can only inherit directly from one class

// The reason for single inheritance is the diamond problem.

	// Any subclass of mammal, anything inheriting from it has the responsibility
	// of defining its own implementation for this method.
